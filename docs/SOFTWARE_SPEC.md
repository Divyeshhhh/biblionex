## Overall Description

### Product Perspective

The BiblioNex library management system is a standalone software application designed to operate within the context of a library environment. It serves as a centralized platform for librarians to manage library resources and for patrons to access and borrow books. While BiblioNex is an independent system, it can integrate with existing library infrastructure such as databases and authentication systems.

### User Classes and Characteristics

BiblioNex caters to two primary user classes:

1. **Librarians**: Librarians are administrators responsible for managing library operations. They have access to advanced functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting books from the library catalog, managing user accounts, tracking book loans, generating reports, and customizing system settings. Librarians are typically well-versed in library management practices and have a comprehensive understanding of the system's capabilities.
2. **Patrons**: Patrons are library users who interact with the system to browse the library catalog, search for books, borrow and return items, and manage their account details. Patrons may vary in their technical proficiency, with some being comfortable navigating the system independently, while others may require assistance from librarians.

### Product Functions

The system is designed to perform a range of major functions, providing users with
a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience. A high-level summary of the functionalities includes:

- **Book Management**: Add, update, and delete books in the library catalog.
- **User Management**: Register and authenticate users, manage user profiles.
